          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            In surgery, vision is everything. Surgical loupes—lightweight
            magnifying glasses worn on the head—give surgeons an enlarged,
            detailed view of the operative field. They are standard in open
            procedures across plastic and reconstructive, orthopedic, vascular,
            ENT, cardiothoracic, and dental surgery, where millimeter-level
            precision matters.

          </figure>

          <p>
            Despite their ubiquity, loupes have seen little meaningful
            innovation in decades:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They force unhealthy posture (neck flexion ~30-40°), driving neck,
              shoulder, and back pain in a large share of surgeons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed optics restrict field of view and require workflow
              interruptions to change magnification.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only the surgeon sees the field, limiting real-time team
              coordination and teaching.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The stakes are especially high in Canada and the United States,
            where surgical demand is rising and clinician shortages are
            projected to grow. Canada anticipates a nationwide physician
            shortfall by 2031, and the U.S. is projected to face a surgeon
            shortfall of roughly <strong>10,100-19,900 by 2036</strong>.
            Extending surgeon careers, reducing fatigue, and improving OR
            efficiency are essential to sustaining capacity.

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <section class="section">
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Prolonged neck flexion drives musculoskeletal strain, lost OR
              days, and shortened careers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Static magnification and narrow FOV force workflow pauses and
              reduce situational awareness.
            </li>
            <li>
              No built-in way to share the surgeon's POV with
              assistants/trainees in real time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dependence on dyes/contrast adds time, consumables, and cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              Little support for modern education or data-driven improvement.

        <!-- Needs Analysis -->
        <section class="section">
          <h3>Needs Analysis</h3>
          <p>Surgeons and OR teams need loupes that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Protect posture</strong> to reduce musculoskeletal strain
              and extend careers—critical in regions facing surgeon shortages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Expand optical flexibility</strong>—wide field when
              needed, high magnification on demand—without breaking surgical
              flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enable real-time sharing</strong> of the operative view
              for tighter team coordination and teaching.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhance recognition</strong> of anatomy without reliance
              on dyes/contrast.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Capture data</strong> (surgeon-eye video) to support
              training, research, AI, and robotics.
            </li>

        <!-- Value Proposition (with quantified gains) -->
        <section class="section">
          <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
          <p>
            LIDDE Loupes are surgical loupes built for today's OR—comfort, clarity,
            and control with measurable impact:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Comfort (Ergonomics):</strong>
              Reduce neck flexion by ~50% (e.g., ~35° → ~15-20°), addressing
              widespread loupe-related pain and protecting career longevity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clarity (Optics):</strong>
              Wider FOV and dynamic magnification cut interruptions.
              Conservatively <strong>3-5 minutes saved per case</strong> from
              fewer swaps/adjustments—freeing ~33 hours per surgeon at 400
              cases/year.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Collaboration (Team View):</strong>
              Low-latency POV sharing helps the whole team see what the surgeon
              sees—reducing miscommunication and keeping cases moving when
              seconds matter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficiency (OR Economics):</strong>
              With OR time often valued around
              <strong>$30-$100 per minute</strong>, saving 5 minutes per case
              yields <strong>$150-$500</strong> recovered per procedure. At
              25-50 cases/year, that's roughly
              <strong>$5,000-$25,000 per surgeon annually</strong>—before
              factoring dye/contrast reductions or avoided repeats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Education:</strong>
              Real-time surgeon-eye view accelerates training and reduces
              reliance on expensive exoscope setups; recordings enable case
              review and skills development.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Future-proof Data:</strong>
              Built-in image/video capture creates surgeon-eye datasets that can
              fuel
              <strong>AI tools, robotic guidance, and clinical research</strong
              >—creating institutional value beyond hardware.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With LIDDE Loupes, surgeons gain comfort, clarity, and control—so they
            can operate longer, see sharper, and easily communicate with their
            team. Ultimately, LIDDE Loupes help surgeons operate at their best—for
            themselves, their teams, and their patients.
